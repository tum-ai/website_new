 * tailwind-merge only knows Tailwind's stock scales. Every custom token and

 * registered here; without it `text-display-xl` would read as a text color
 * and be dropped next to `text-fg`. Keep this list in sync with the theme
 * (`src/lib/cn.test.ts` checks the important pairs).
 *
 * Colors need no entry: tailwind-merge treats any unknown `text-*`, `bg-*`
 * or `border-*` value as a color, so `bg-canvas` and `text-fg-muted` already
 * conflict with `bg-raised` and `text-fg`.
