            We are not an educational program. That means you are not only
            joining to learn but also to contribute to the development of the
            organization. We don't give in-depth lectures or crash courses in AI
            and coding yet - you need to interact with other members to learn
            things. Help is always given to those who ask. We do a lot of
            organizational work - the AI ecosystem is not ready, and you will be
            part of building it up. We have a membership fee of 10â‚¬ per semester
            for all of our active members.{" "}
