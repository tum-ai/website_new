Together with my team, we organized 2 industry phases and drastically increased income for the initiative to 6 figures, on top of increasing the number of available projects to the TUM.ai community by over 300%. Being a team lead at TUM.ai allowed me to gain first-hand leadership experience and have the creative freedom to direct a department of 10+ people. As a team lead you get to shape the project of your department and learn how to coordinate efforts to accomplish your goals. Moreover, you gain an insight into the management team and can directly shape the initiative. Shortly after joining, I met a few members who were going to top US universities like Harvard, MIT, and Stanford. This motivated me to pursue these same ambitions myself and do research at Harvard. TUM.ai helped me immensely in expanding my horizons of what is possible to do during university. Overall, TUM.ai has been an amazing experience to connect with like-minded individuals. I have met incredibly inspiring friends who are on track to shape the AI landscape, from startup cofounders to super-smart AI researchers. It is hard to find a place that attracts so many talented people.

Together, we designed, prototyped, and implemented a novel approach to support material scientists in discovering new inorganic materials. We then benchmarked our solution against state-of-the-art systems—one of which I implemented myself. Finally, we summarized our findings in a paper, which was successfully accepted! Next, I traveled to a GenAI Hackathon in Paris with two fellow TUM.ai members—by far my most memorable hackathon experience, even though we only secured a very close second place. Shortly after, I joined the recruiting team, gaining hands-on experience in shaping and evolving this exceptional TUM.ai community. We gathered extensive feedback, optimized processes, organized events, and designed the screening and interview procedures. I especially enjoy meeting our diverse applicants during in-person interviews. Overall, my journey with TUM.ai has been defined by countless inspiring individuals—some of whom became close friends, while others introduced me to opportunities I had never imagined.
