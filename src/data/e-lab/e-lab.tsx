Starting with traditional subjects like finance and accounting, I have continually expanded my horizon to areas more strongly focused on innovation and technology management. Herein, my focus currently lies on but is not limited to AI. My journey has taken me across different countries and industries like the financial sector, shipping, and fruits wholesale.\n\n" +
      "More importantly, I have had the chance to get immersed in two European innovation hubs: Paris and Munich. The German capital of beer and Weißwurst specifically caught my attention due to its proximity between tech and business which is hard to find elsewhere at the same scale. In the two years since I stepped my foot into the city, it has done everything else but disappointed. So, I am looking very forward to learning how you are contributing to this awesome vibe!\n\n" +
