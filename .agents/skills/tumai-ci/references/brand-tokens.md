# TUM.ai brand tokens

Summary of `docs/brand/source/` (brand guide PDF and `colors.jpeg`) as implemented in
`src/styles/index.css`. If this file and `index.css` disagree, `index.css` wins; fix this file.

## Identity

The brand guide frames TUM.ai as the hub where academic rigour meets a make-it-happen builder
mindset.

- Mission: "To bridge the gap between theory and practice by empowering students to build the
  future of AI."
- Vision: "To be the defining hub for AI talent in Europe, a community where technical precision
  meets human creativity."

For UI that means clean and technically precise, confident and modern, community-oriented but
restrained. If a choice looks more like generic SaaS than TUM.ai, simplify it.

## Palette (brand anchors)

| Name | Hex | Theme token | Main use |
|---|---|---|---|
| White | #FFFFFF | `--color-white` | `paper` band, text on dark bands |
| Minimal Grey | #EFEFEF | `--color-minimal-gray` | `mist` band |
| Lavender Tint | #F5EFFF | `--color-lavender-tint`, `violet-50` | `lavender` band, soft emphasis |
| Electric Lavender (TUM.ai violet) | #9A64D9 | `--color-tumai-violet`, `violet-500` | accent, large type, focus ring, `violet` band |
| Dark Purple | #523573 | `--color-dark-purple`, `violet-800` | primary hover, gradient end |
| Dark Indigo | #1B0049 | `--color-dark-indigo`, `violet-950` | `ink` band, text on light bands |
| Black | #0D0214 | `--color-black`, `ink-950` | `night` band, footer, root canvas |
| Electric Fade | #9A64D9 to #523573 | gradient | highlights (`Highlight variant="fade"`) |

Derived scales (never invent other hues):

- `violet-50…950`: 500 is the brand violet, 800 dark purple, 950 dark indigo. **violet-600
  (#8052C2)** is the primary button fill: white text on it reaches 5.4:1 (AA), which violet-500
  does not.
- `ink-50…950`: violet-tinted neutrals for rare surfaces and text.

## Tones

`<Section tone>` sets `data-tone`, which defines the semantic tokens below. Each foreground pair
meets WCAG AA on its canvas.

| Tone | Canvas | Text | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `paper` | #FFFFFF | dark indigo | default reading band |
| `mist` | #EFEFEF | dark indigo | alternate light band |
| `lavender` | #F5EFFF | dark indigo | soft emphasis, forms, FAQs |
| `ink` | #1B0049 | white | heroes, feature bands, CTAs |
| `night` | #0D0214 | white | deep contrast, footer |
| `violet` | #9A64D9 | black | large type only (stats), sparingly |

Semantic utilities: `bg-canvas`, `bg-raised`, `bg-sunken`, `text-fg`, `text-fg-muted`,
`text-fg-subtle`, `border-hairline`, `border-hairline-strong`, `text-highlight` (AA-safe accent
per tone), and tone-aware tints such as `bg-fg/[0.07]`.

## Typography

Manrope (`public/assets/Manrope.ttf`, loaded in `src/app/(site)/layout.tsx`) is the only typeface.
The brand guide sets H1 120pt/1.0, H2 80pt/1.1, H3 48pt/1.2 and text 21pt/1.4; the site scales
these fluidly:

| Utility | Size | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `text-display-2xl` | up to 128px | home hero only |
| `text-display-xl` | up to 100px | page heroes |
| `text-display-lg` | up to 72px | big statements, CTAs |
| `text-display-md` | up to 54px | section titles |
| `text-heading-lg` / `-md` / `-sm` | 34 / 23 / 17px | card and sub-section titles |
| `text-lead` | up to 21px | intros |
| `text-body` / `text-small` / `text-meta` | 16 / 14 / 13px | copy and metadata |
| `text-eyebrow` | 12px uppercase | labels above headlines |

Display sizes are medium weight with tight negative tracking. Hierarchy comes from size and
weight, not decoration.

## Logos

- `public/assets/tum_ai_logo_new.svg`: the primary logo (the homepage's only preloaded image).
- `public/assets/logo_new_white_standard.png`: white logo, only on dark enough backgrounds.
- `public/assets/favicon.svg`, `favicon-96.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, `src/app/icon.svg`: icons.
- `BrandMark` (`src/components/ds/brand-mark.tsx`): the logomark geometry as a large tonal
  background shape, as on the brand guide's section slides. Decoration only, never a logo.

Never redraw, recolour, crop or rebuild the logo.

## Buttons and interaction

Canonical implementation: `src/components/ds/button.tsx` (`buttonStyles`, `Button`,
`ButtonLink`, `IconButton`).

- `primary`: violet-600 fill, white label, dark purple on hover, a single sheen on hover.
- `secondary`, `outline`, `ghost`: read the surrounding tone, so they work on light and dark bands.
- `inverse`: solid white, for secondary actions on dark bands and photos.
- `link`: inline text action in the tone's highlight colour.
- Sizes `sm`, `md`, `lg`; a badge next to a button uses the same size step.
- Focus: a global 3px violet ring with offset (violet-300 on dark bands). Never remove it.

Interaction feels crisp and confident, never bouncy: small hover zoom (1.04), arrow nudges, a 4px
lift, `ease-brand`.
